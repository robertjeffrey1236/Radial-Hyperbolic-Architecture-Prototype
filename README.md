# Radial-Hyperbolic-Architecture-Prototype
Python prototype for efficient hierarchical computing in Poincaré disk. Features dual Φ spirals, fractal recursion, lazy loading, multi-point observers with portals, Φ percolation for Penrose shadows, atomic scaling with wormholes/phonons, and music substrate via JI harmonics. Simulates emergent patterns on bounded resources.
