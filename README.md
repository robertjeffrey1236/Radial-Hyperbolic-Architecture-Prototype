# Radial-Hyperbolic-Architecture-Prototype

Python prototype for efficient hierarchical computing in the Poincaré disk. Features dual Φ (golden ratio) spirals, fractal recursion, lazy loading, multi-point observers with portals, Φ percolation for Penrose shadows, atomic scaling with wormholes/phonons, and music substrate via Just Intonation (JI) harmonics. Simulates emergent patterns on bounded resources.

## Overview

This prototype explores a novel computing architecture inspired by hyperbolic geometry, natural patterns (golden ratio spirals, honeycombs), and physical/quantum analogies:

- **Hyperbolic embedding** in the Poincaré disk for exponentially growing hierarchical data without boundary issues.
- **Dual golden spirals** (expansive and contractive) combined with a honeycomb lattice for atomic-scale resolution.
- **Fractal recursion** and **lazy loading** for efficient resource use on bounded hardware.
- **Multi-point observers** with "portals" (overlapping views) enabling distributed/shared computation.
- **Φ-percolation** to create emergent Penrose-like quasiperiodic shadows.
- **Wormholes** as random shortcuts (quantum tunneling analog).
- **Phonon vibrations** simulated via small perturbations.
- **Zeckendorf encoding** (Fibonacci-based) for compact hierarchical addressing.
- Future extensions planned for Just Intonation music substrate.

The code generates a visual representation of the structure using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
